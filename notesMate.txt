#-- Step by Step Work Guide --#

1. - Install Laravel Work directory: 

		->composer create-project laravel/laravel groteszkMate

2. - Implementing Authentication in Laravel using Tailwind UI (Admin Panel):

		->composer require laravel/ui, 

		->php artisan jetstream:install livewire

3. - Create Migrations & Make Seeder for first user authentication 

		->php artisan make:migration create_users_table,
		(also make create_company_table, create_employee_table)
		->php artisan make:seeder UserSeeder,
		(also employeeSeeder, controllerSeeder with faker for data)
		->php artisan migrate
		(create datatables)
		->php artisan db:seed
		(upload fakers)
4. - CRUD Tasks
		->php artisan make:model companyModel-m
		->php artisan make:controller companyController --resource 
		(make models & controllers, also homeModel - homeController, employeeModel - employeeController)

5. - Set Route endpoint

6. - Use index, create, store, edit, delete controller functions, attach table data params to view.

7. - Handle client data (required params, picture min&max size) with $request->validate, also handle client file/logo.
     ----> If logo exist, copy to public/logo directory. In case of missing file, the value = "" <----

8. - Added Laravel Pagination, limit 10

9. - Bootstrap template is used for the UI

10. - Create mailing system

		->php artisan make:mail NewCompanyReminderMail
		(also edit e-mail content for basic rule & include in store function in case of adding new company)

//LOCALIZATION - LARAVEL ANOMALY (see under the visible routes in comment)
11. - Missing required parameter for [Route:companyEdit] [URI:{locale}/company/{id}/edit][Missing paraneter: id]

	**** made locales, and lang.home.php file ****
	**** Reference to: {{ __('home.adminDescriptipn') }} ****
	**** until two params({locale} and {id}) has appeared, laravel was not capable of resolving the url correctly -> [Route:companyEdit] [URI:{locale}/company/{id}/edit][Missing paraneter: id] ****
	**** the url was this for instance: https://localhost/barta-mate/groteszkMate/public/hu/company/16/edit ****
	**** views.language.eng.app ==> you can find a commented language selection, that was the original idea ****
